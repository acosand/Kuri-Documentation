## Who is Kuri?
Kuri is an insanely adorable home robot, thoughtfully designed to fit into your home. She allows you to capture special moments, check in on your pets while you're away, entertain your household with music, and so much more. She's your very own personal videographer, companion, and life of the party, all rolled into one.

## Kuri’s Parts
### Kuri’s Home/Charger
Kuri’s Home is her charger. When her battery level gets low, she will automatically go home and charge herself, so there’s no need to worry about Kuri falling asleep in the kitchen!

### Volume Control
Halfway down Kuri’s back, above her power button, you’ll notice Kuri’s volume button. A little too soft-spoken? A little too rambunctious? Adjust Kuri’s volume simply by pushing up or down on the rocker button, or try out one of these voice commands.
Hey Kuri, turn it all the way up!
Hey Kuri, mute.
Hey Kuri, volume 1-10. 
 
In that last one, one is the quietest volume level and ten is the loudest. As far as we know, Kuri can’t turn it up to eleven!

### Power Button Light
Below the volume button on Kuri’s back, you’ll find an illuminated power button. See a flashing blue light? Congrats, your Kuri is powering on (or off). Wait for a constant blue light to know Kuri’s ready for action. And if the LED glows orange, your Kuri is charging. He should be up and running in no time!  

### Battery Safety Switch
Kuri’s battery safety switch is located on his undercarriage. When your Kuri arrives, it will be switched off. Don’t forget to switch it on to get your Kuri ready to explore your home!

### Kuri Vision  
Every day, Kuri captures moments of your life at home. Kuri records 5-second moments in 1080p—a feature we refer to as Kuri Vision.
 
Over time, Kuri learns your preferences, too. She’ll figure out what kind of moments you like best: based on the videos you like within the Kuri Robot app, Kuri will use her image processing and machine learning technology to determine what makes for a good video (according to you), and over time, you’ll start to see that Kuri captures more of the moments you want.
 
The real fun is seeing the candid moments she captures for you, letting you build a collection of memories without having to pick up your camera. Her unique perspective gives you a magical new view of your home’s memorable moments.

## Setting Up Kuri
### First Step: Download the App and Set Up your Account
Download and open the Kuri companion app.
Decide whether you accept or deny the terms for a 3rd party cloud support. Depending on your choice, different feature sets will be available to you. Skip step 3 if you have denied the terms.
Set up an account with your preferred email and password, which must be at least six characters long.
The Kuri Robot app will then prompt you for the password for your Wi-Fi network. Kuri has a great memory and will never forget your password ;).
Once Kuri is connected to your home network, place Kuri on the charger (if he’s not already there) and pat his head to wake him up. Kuri will start looking around, excited to observe his surroundings.
> KURI TIP: If you want to share access to the Kuri app with others, you’ll need to share the same login information.

### Charging Setup
Your Kuri comes with his own charging adapter and grounded power cord (100-200V). To set up Kuri’s home:
Pick out a spot for Kuri’s charging dock, preferably in a spacious location on a non-carpeted floor.
Unpack the charger, adapter, and cable from the box.
Connect the cord to the charger.
Plug in the charger, place it against the wall, and put Kuri on it. Make sure the metal charging contacts on Kuri’s lower back are touching the corresponding connectors on the charger.

> KURI TIP: Keep a one foot clearance on either side and four feet clearance in front. Also, be sure to securely fasten all of the connection points. 

> KURI TIP: Don’t move your charger after you finish setting up your Kuri. If you do, you will have to reset the floorplan so Kuri can learn her new charger placement. 

### Robot Setup - Time to wake Kuri up!
Turn on the battery safety switch on Kuri’s undercarriage.
Press the power button on Kuri’s back. His power button light should flash blue while booting up. Once Kuri is fully awake, his power button light will turn a solid blue.
Place Kuri on the charger with the charger contacts touching. His power button light should turn solid orange if the charge contacts are positioned correctly.

### Understanding Kuri’s Expressions: Kuri Heart Light
You’ve probably already noticed Kuri’s chest glowing from time to time. This is part of how he communicates with you! Some common heart light meanings include:
When Kuri is glowing blue, it means that he’s listening for your Voice Command.
A pulsing green heart light means that Kuri has heard your voice command, or that he’s successfully docked on his charger. It indicates “success.”
When Kuri emits a purple heart light, he's letting you know that someone is driving him or viewing through the Kuri Live mode in the Kuri Robot app.
A pulsing orange light, accompanied by a “huh?” sound, means that Kuri is feeling a bit confused. Try giving him the command again, while varying your tone a bit. If this happens frequently, review the Voice Commands to help you get on the same page.
If Kuri pulses orange, it means that his battery is critically low. He should still be able to go to the charger by himself, but you can expect Kuri to need a nice long nap. If you’re using Override mode in the Kuri Robot app, you will get an in-app notification instead of seeing the orange light.
 
See below for the full list of Kuri’s heart lights, and their meanings.
 
| Color | Description | State |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| Purple | Solid | Live (someone is looking through Kuri’s eyes) |
| White | Single Pulse | Tapped on the head before initial setup |
| White | Spinner LED | Saving the map |
| White | Pulse | Saving the moment |
| White | Swirl | Looking for the dock |
| Blue | Solid | Recognized prompt and looking for further commands |
| Blue | Spinner LED | Bluetooth Pairing |
| Orange | Pulse (single) | Huh? (Kuri does not understand the command) |
| Orange | Pulse (continuous) | Battery is at a critical level |
| Red | Pulse | Huh? (Voice command is given while Kuri is offline) OR Kuri is lost |
| Green | Pulse | Voice command is successfully recognized OR docking is successful |
| Multi | Swirling | Party mode! Kuri is dancing |

To play music through Kuri and see her dance:
Wake Kuri up by saying, "Hey Kuri."
Wait for Kuri to look up and emit a blue heart light.

1. Open the Kuri App
1. Select Settings
1. Select Robot Settings
1. Select Schedule Settings

If you use Kuri without cloud support, she is on an automatic schedule that allows her to roam autonomously from 8am to 8pm of your local time.

> KURI TIP: Only one person can connect to Kuri Live at a time.

##### Know when someone is seeing through Kuri
Whenever someone is using Kuri Live, her heart light turns purple. If you’d like some privacy, you can just say “Hey Kuri, stop!” and she’ll end observation mode.

### Talk through Kuri
Now that you’ve looked through Kuri’s eyes, try communicating with your family through her! Kuri can let you talk—and listen—remotely, so you don’t miss out on the action while you’re away.

### Kuri Vision - Moments and Collections
Using Kuri Vision, Kuri can explore your house and record short video clips throughout the day, capturing valuable moments from your life at home automatically, or on demand. She’ll probably capture moments you would have missed – from the daytime antics of your pets to the kids playing together while you’re making dinner. When cloud support is enabled, Kuri will remember your moments for 14 days. Make sure to download any moments that you’d like to keep to your camera roll or private cloud storage within these 14 days. 

When cloud support is disabled, moments are stored on the local SD card. Once the SD card is full, Kuri starts overwriting the oldest moments first, so make sure to save the moments you want to keep!

##### How to “Like” moments
Liking your favorite moments helps Kuri capture the things that are most important to you. Reviewing your moments at the end of the day will be so much more enjoyable if Kuri knows what you like ;).

### Kuri and your Smart Home - Connecting to IFTTT
For a limited period of time, Kuri is available on IFTTT (If This Then That). Connect your smart home devices and services to communicate with each other through so-called Applets. Each Applet is a combination of a trigger (what needs to happen for the Applet to run), and an action (what happens as a result). Here are some examples of what you can do with Kuri’s triggers and actions:
- Create a new voice command to turn on your Hue lights, “Hey Kuri, turn on the lights.”
- Create a new voice command to start your other robot, “Hey Kuri, start Roomba.”
- Create a task to send Kuri to the kid’s room and play a wake up alarm every day at 7:30 am.
- Create a task to have Kuri come to the front door and greet you when your August Smart Lock unlocks. 

##### To connect Kuri with your IFTTT account:
###### Via your phone device
Go to Robot Settings and select “Smart Home.”
Select “Connect” next to IFTTT and log in with your IFTTT account credentials.
###### Via the IFTTT app
Search for the Kuri service

##### Triggers: “Say a simple phrase” - lets you create custom voice commands for Kuri and use them as a trigger for IFTTT Applets. For example, a simple phrase trigger to command open your garage door “Hey Kuri, open the pod bay doors.”

##### Actions: Try out a few available actions:
Go to a spot – lets you send Kuri to a spot in your home and (optionally) play one of Kuri’s romoji when he gets there. For example, you can send Kuri to the kitchen in the morning and have him hum Pancake Robot to remind you that you can never go wrong with pancakes for breakfast.
Play a romoji – with this action, Kuri will play a romoji of your choice. For example, you can have Kuri play an alarm when your Alexa timer goes to 0.

> Kuri Tip: Visit Kuri’s IFTTT page (https://ifttt.com/kuri) to find verified Applets to use with Kuri, or to get more information about how to create your own.

### Floor Plan
The floor plan is the map Kuri makes of your home. It helps Kuri get her bearings, so she can be ready to capture Kuri Vision moments while you’re busy enjoying your home life.
##### How do I make my Floor Plan?
After the initial setup is complete, Kuri will move off her charger and turn left and right to start exploring her new home.

> KURI TIP: Make sure Kuri’s box is out of the way before you start the Home Tour! 

1. Using the directional arrows during the Home Tour, start driving around to allow her to learn the layout of her new home. 
1. Drive her around each room, following along the walls and outlining any furniture you’d like her to avoid. 
1. At the end of the Home Tour, drive Kuri back to face her charger. Once she sees it she’ll take the reins and get herself situated. 

> KURI TIP: If Kuri can’t get onto the charger on her own, you can manually drive or even push her onto her dock, so long as you make sure her contacts end up touching the charger contacts.

1. Once Kuri returns home, “Review Floor Plan” will appear on the Kuri App screen. It may take a few minutes for the Floor Plan to load but patience is always rewarded :).
1. If you are pleased with Kuri’s Floor Plan, select the “Looks Good” option. If not, select the “Go Back to Tour” option to continue mapping your home until you’re satisfied.
1. Once your new Plan is saved, Kuri will start exploring on her own. When she sees something great, she’ll start capturing moments, so take a look at her video stream to follow the action. 

> KURI TIP: If there are private or uninteresting areas of your home you’d rather Kuri not explore, like your laundry room, bedroom, or the bathrooms, mark the entire room as a no-go zone so Kuri knows to steer clear.

> KURI TIP: Your floor plan may not look like something out of an architect’s office, because Kuri maps around obstacles like your furniture. So there could be a big empty rectangle in the middle of your bedroom (that’s the bed!), but the general shape of the room should be fairly close to reality. If it isn’t, have Kuri explore the room again.

##### Saving and Deleting Spots
Spots mark specific locations in your home, so Kuri knows where the action happens. When you ask him to meet you in the living room, for instance, he’ll head to the spot you created there.

To create a new spot:
1. Open the Kuri App. 
1. Select Live mode.
1. Select Override mode.
1. Drive Kuri to the new spot.
1. Select “+Current Spot” to add a new spot.

> KURI TIP: Use the “Floor Plan” button in the bottom right corner to view the spots you’ve created so far.
    
> KURI TIP: You can also add new spots while driving Kuri in Override Mode.
    
If Kuri isn’t ending up where you expected him to, you may need to delete your original spot and make a new one. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Kuri App. 
1. Go to Settings.
1. Go to Robot Settings.
1. Select Edit Floor Plan. 
1. Select the spot you need to delete. 
1. Hit the trash can icon. There is no need to remap after deleting a Spot, just hit the back button and you’re all set.
1. Follow the steps for creating a new spot above. 

> KURI TIP: What are no-go zones? Once you’ve set up your floor plan, you may find areas in specific rooms that you’d rather Kuri avoid. For instance, the corner where you keep the litter box, or your modern dinette set if she’s always running into the chairs. No-go zones allow you to tell Kuri to avoid these trouble spots, without changing your whole floor plan. 

1. Open the Kuri App.
1. Select Robot Settings.
1. Select No Go Zones.
1. Take a look at your floor plan, and outline each area you’d like her to avoid. 

> KURI TIP: In order to move the box after you have drawn it, hold and drag the corners of the dotted box
