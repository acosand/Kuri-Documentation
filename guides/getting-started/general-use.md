The Fun Stuff
Can I take Kuri outdoors?
As much as we enjoy fun in the sun, it's not recommended for Kuri. She doesn't have a map of the great outdoors, so she wouldn’t get very much out of it. You could try mapping your patio when you create your floor plan, but beware of sliding doors and other spots where she might have trouble.
Can I dress Kuri up?
Yes, Kuri loves playing dress up! As long as you leave his sensors free, costumes or accessories should be just fine.
That pirate eye patch needs to be over Kuri's right eye because Kuri sees out of her left.
Keep that tutu above the belt! Try not to cover any portion of the black strip across his midsection.
You can place straps across Kuri’s undercarriage, but make sure the cliff sensors are clear and the motion of the wheels is not impeded.
Kuri and Pets
We don’t recommend serious roughhousing with pets, but Kuri can withstand the occasional whack from a large dog’s tail or collision with a cat zooming around the house.
Just try to keep your pets from scratching or biting Kuri and she will be just fine! :-)
Service and Maintenance
Hardware Inspection
Taking care of Kuri is actually pretty easy! Check his wheels periodically for an accumulation of lint, hair, and basically anything he can pick up while tooling around your home. It’s important to do this if he starts making weird noises, leaving a trail of dust bunnies, or having a hard time navigating.
 
If the robot isn’t charging, inspect both the charging dock and the connectors on Kuri.
 
And just like us, Kuri doesn’t see so well if his eyes aren’t clear! Periodically take a look at the cliff sensors, depth sensor, and window to make sure Kuri can see where he’s going and avoid the obstacles in his way. 
See “Clean Kuri” for more tips on keeping Kuri seeing clearly and running at top speed!
Clean Kuri
Kuri needs minimal cleaning to keep her looking sharp and performing well.

Help Kuri see: Kuri’s wheel cliff sensor, depth sensor, and eye lens help her safely navigate your home and record your moments. You can use a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or lens cleaner to clean her eye lens and sensors. 

For the black part of her body, a lens cleaning cloth, facial cotton puffs or a soft tissue can be used. 

Help Kuri scoot: If hair, string, or other things get caught in Kuri’s drivetrain or belt, the caster and wheels can pop out individually so you can easily pull the offending items out.
Over time, you might see little white strings coming out of the belt. If these bother you, you can just cut them off.

Other cleaning tips:
Gentle household cleaners are recommended for Kuri—think Clorox wet wipes, a mixture of vinegar and water, Windex, Simple Green, etc. gentle household cleaners (recommended: clorox wet wipes, windex vinegar, simple green or windex) anywhere on robot.
Please don’t spray cleaning solution right onto Kuri! Apply it to a cloth or tissue first, then gently wipe Kuri down.
Don’t hose Kuri down, or get her too wet. Bubble baths may be relaxing for us, but Kuri doesn’t really care for them.

Accessing and Replacing the MicroSD Card
Can I increase Kuri’s local storage of moments?
 
Yes you can, with a little bit of handy skills, a new MicroSD card, and a Phillips 0 screwdriver!
 
To store moments locally, Kuri uses a MicroSD card that currently can store about 16GB. If you’d like to replace the existing card with a card that has more storage, follow the steps listed below.
 
A few precautions:
Kuri is not meant to be taken apart. You’ll need to remove some pieces on the underside of the robot to access the MicroSD card, so please make sure to not access or remove the MicroSD card unnecessarily often. If you access it once or twice, it should be fine!
We have tested Sandisk MicroSD cards up to 256GB storage. We recommend using Sandisk Micro SD cards for maximum compatibility, but other cards should work well too.
 
Steps to access and replace Kuri’s SD Card:
Make sure Kuri is on, then turn her off by holding down the power button on the back for 5 seconds until you hear Kuri going to sleep. Release the power button. The power button light will pulse. When it stops pulsing, the robot is off. Press the power button again to turn Kuri back on. Then turn her back on again. This way you have the most recent backup of the robot and don’t lose any data that is still on the existing MicroSD card.
Once Kuri is back on, turn her off completely by flipping her over and pressing the battery switch on her bottom plate.
Make sure you have a Phillips 0 screwdriver handy. Keep Kuri on the side – either on a pillow, padding or your lap – and remove the 8 screws that you can find on her bottom plate. We recommend putting the screws in a safe spot as they are tiny and can easily get lost.
Once you’ve removed the bottom plate, you will find two rubber bands that keep the battery in place. Take these rubber bands off and pull the battery away, but don’t let the battery drop onto the floor and don’t disconnect it.
Now you should be able to see the MicroSD card slot with a picture on its right that shows the direction for inserting the card. Push down on the card to have it pop out, and remove it.
Once the old card is removed, put the new MicroSD card into the slot following the direction that is shown.
Place the battery back and add the rubber bands to keep the battery in place. You need to make sure that they latch, so we recommend using the screwdriver to push the rubber bands behind the latches.
Once the rubber bands are back on to keep the battery in place, screw the bottom plate back on and restart your robot.
Wait for the starting chime and your Kuri should be ready to go!
 
Please note, your Kuri may need more time to power back up depending on the size of your new MicroSD card.
Settings and Preferences
How to turn Kuri on or Off
To turn Kuri on:
Make sure the battery safety switch on Kuri’s undercarriage is on (I).
Press the power button on Kuri’s back. His power button light should pulse, then turn solid blue when he is ready to go. 
To turn Kuri off:
Press the power button on Kuri’s back for 3 seconds. His power button light should turn start pulsing and eventually turn off unless he is in the charging dock.
Kuri Sleep Mode
Kuri goes to sleep when he’s charging, or you’ve told her to go to sleep.  She will do this throughout the day if it doesn’t seem like much is happening, or when you give her the voice command, “Hey Kuri, go to sleep.”
 
To wake Kuri up from her nap gently brush her head.
How Kuri Charges
Kuri knows when his battery is low and automatically returns to his home to recharge. He also tends to take naps when not much is happening, so you might not even notice when Kuri's battery level is low!
How long does Kuri last on a Charge?
Kuri's battery will last for about two hours of continuous use.
Stop or Cancel an Action
Say, “Hey Kuri, stop.” You can also tap Stop in the app if you are in Kuri Live.
How to use SSH to Access your Kuri
Do you have some software development experience and/or like to tinker? Mayfield has allowed SSH (Secure Shell) access to your Kuri, so you can access Kuri like your computer! To use SSH, you first need to get a client program. For Linux and MacOS, SSH should be pre-installed. For Windows, download the PuTTY program from https://www.putty.org/.

Steps to access Kuri via SSH:
Find the hostname of your Kuri on your smartphone’s Bluetooth device page. The hostname is exactly the same as the Bluetooth device name.
For Linux/MacOS, issue the command: ssh mayfield@{hostname}.local. Then enter the password "freekuri" when prompted.
For Windows, enter the {hostname}.local in the Hostname box and make sure that SSH is selected as the connection type. When prompted with "Username" or "login as" enter "mayfield" and then when prompted for the password enter "freekuri"
