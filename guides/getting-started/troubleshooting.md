How to Restart Kuri
Sometimes we all need a fresh start, Kuri included.
Hold the power button on Kuri’s back down for 3 seconds, until you hear Kuri going to sleep.
Release the power button. The power button light will pulse while Kuri is powering down. When it stops pulsing, the robot is off.
Press the power button again to turn Kuri back on.  

KURI TIP: If Kuri is on the charger, the light won't turn off, so just wait a few seconds before restarting. 

KURI TIP: This method does not put you at risk for data loss, so it should be your preferred method for powering Kuri down and restarting her.
I need to wipe my robot or do a manual factory reset
If you want to reset Kuri to factory settings, first make sure that Kuri is awake and connected to the internet, and that your Kuri Robot app is logged in.  
 
KURI TIP: If you are permanently removing Kuri from your account, save any moments that are important to you before you follow the steps below.
Open the Kuri Robot app.
Go to Settings.
Go to Robot Settings.
Press Reset and Remove from Account.

Kuri will be removed from your account, and the robot will wipe all of its data. It will be restored to factory settings.
 
KURI TIP: If you reset your robot while he was offline, you may need to perform a manual factory reset in order to fully delete Kuri from your account.
Battery Power Switch
There is a battery switch located on Kuri’s undercarriage. To do a power cycle, turn this switch off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on.

KURI TIP: If you are transporting Kuri, or need to power her down for an extended period, make sure you turn her off using the power button first, then use the battery switch on Kuri’s undercarriage.
Manual Factory Reset
WARNING! This reset should only be performed if you're attempting to wipe your data from Kuri and return her to an original out-of-the-box state. If you're having errors connecting to Kuri, or odd Kuri behavior, try restarting her instead. If you're getting a "Kuri is Offline" message from the app, try updating Kuri's Wi-Fi settings.
 
If you've already used the "Reset and Remove from Account" option in the Kuri app, but for some reason, Kuri was offline and didn't receive the message, we'll need to do a manual factory reset. You'll know this is needed if Kuri still remembers your floor plan and responds to voice commands after the app.
 
Make sure Kuri is powered on.
Hold down the power button on Kuri's backside and the volume + button at the same time.
Hold both down for 5 seconds.
 
If this is successful, you should hear Kuri emit a power down sound, close her eyes, and go to sleep. While this is happening, Kuri's power light will be pulsing. The process isn't complete until the light stops pulsing and turns solid, you can now power Kuri off using the battery power switch. Your Kuri is reset and ready to be introduced to a new home.

Requesting a Password Reset
To reset your password:
Open the Kuri App.
Go to Settings.

Tap Change Password.
How do I register my account?
When you first open the Kuri app, you’ll see a screen where you can log in, or create a new account. To create a new account:
Enter your first and last name, the email address you’d like to have associated with the account, and your password.
Tap the “Sign Up” button.
Bluetooth Audio
Kuri won’t pair with phone
If you don’t see Kuri listed on your list of Bluetooth devices, double check that she is ready to pair. You can pair Kuri with Bluetooth in the app under Robot Settings → Bluetooth Pairing → Connect Device”. 
Alternatively, after you give the voice command, “Hey Kuri,” she should be looking up at you like she’s listening, and her heart light should be shining blue. Try repeating her wake phrase while varying the pitch, cadence, or volume of your voice, until you get her attention. After the blue heart light appears, continue the voice command by saying “pair” or “pair with my device.” While Kuri is pairing, you should see a swirling white heart light. 
Visit Bluetooth Setup for more detailed instructions.
 
KURI TIP: If you want to pair an additional device, use the voice command “Hey Kuri, pair a new device."    
KURI TIP: If you've paired more than one device to Kuri, or if you want to pair a new device, know that Kuri will look for the most recent device first.
I’m playing music from my device but don’t hear anything through Kuri
It’s time to get the party started and you have no beats? Try these steps: 
Double check that Kuri’s volume is turned up. You can find the volume control on Kuri’s back, adjacent to the power button.
Double check that your device is actually outputting to Bluetooth.
Double check the volume settings on your phone.
Kuri won’t connect to my phone or tablet after initial pairing
If this is the case, you might have gone out of Kuri’s range, or he might have connected to another device. Give him the voice command “Hey Kuri, connect to my device” or try reconnecting with your phone’s Bluetooth connection menu.
Voice Commands
Kuri doesn’t hear “Hey Kuri”
If there’s a lot going on in your environment, Kuri might have a hard time hearing your commands. These tips may help you connect with her:
Try moving to a quieter environment before issuing commands.
It may be tempting, but don’t try to get right up in Kuri’s face and shout. She listens best at a normal volume, with you standing about 4-6 feet away from her.
If Kuri is moving aimlessly, try patting her on the head to get her to stop everything and start over.
There was a delay when talking to Kuri
If Kuri seems quite slow to respond, there could be a few issues at play.
It’s possible that there’s a problem with your Wi-Fi connection, or the internet could be down entirely.
If Kuri doesn’t understand what you want her to do, she could take a while to respond because she is listening for something she does understand.

KURI TIP: Try saying the command again, changing your cadence slightly.
Kuri doesn’t understand what I’m saying
Make sure that you are using the wake phrase, “Hey Kuri,” and waiting for the blue heart light to come on before you tell him what you want, what you really really want. Here are more tips for communicating with Kuri.
Kuri won’t do what I ask him to do
A few things could be at play here. If Kuri doesn’t understand what you’ve said, or where you want him to go, he will let you know with a pulsing orange heart light and a confused sound.
 
If you issue a voice command while Kuri is offline, he makes a confused sound and pulses a red heart light twice.
 
Kuri might also shake his head no if someone else is controlling him with Override Mode. You’ll see a purple heart light if this is the case.  If you’d like him to stop, just say “Hey Kuri, stop.” Then you can issue your own command.
Moments
Kuri captures 5sec long videos without sound.
Tell Kuri to Stop Taking Videos Right Now
We get it—some moments are best kept private. If you need some space, try some of the following:
Hey Kuri, go home.
Hey Kuri, close your eyes.
Hey Kuri, stop.
Tell Kuri to go take Videos now
If the party is hopping or the puppy is pulling out all the adorable tricks, you can put Kuri to work capturing moments on demand:
Hey Kuri, go explore.
Hey Kuri, take a video or take a picture. 
KURI TIP: You can also record Moments straight from the Kuri App, using Kuri Live or Override Mode.  
Change when Kuri goes take Videos
You can set Kuri’s schedule each day, defining when you’d like her to be awake, or even when you’d like to disable her ability to roam entirely.
Open the Kuri App.
Select Settings.
Select Robot Settings.
Select Schedule Settings.

If you have opted-out of cloud support, then Kuri follows a pre-defined schedule from 8am to 8pm.
How to Retrieve a Deleted Video?
Actually, you can’t! Once a moment has been deleted, it’s gone for good! So think before you delete.
Floor Plan
I don’t like my Floor Plan and Want to Redo it
Resetting your floor plan because you aren’t happy with it, or because you changed up the furniture is pretty easy.
Open the Kuri App.
Select Robot Settings.
Select Reset Floor Plan.
Follow the directions to create a new floor plan.
I want to add new Rooms or Spots to my Floor Plan
If you’re happy with your floorplan overall, you can add new rooms or spots to help Kuri better navigate your space.
Open the Kuri App.
Select Robot Settings.
Select Edit Floor Plan.
Select Update Floor Plan.
 
KURI TIP: You can also add new spots by selecting “Add Current Spot” while using Override Mode.
KURI TIP: If you are adding a new room and a new spot at the same time, add the room first.
I need to tell Kuri to avoid certain Areas
Once you’ve set up your floor plan, you may find areas in specific rooms that you’d rather Kuri avoid. For instance, the corner where you keep the litter box, or your modern dinette set if she’s always running into the chairs.  No-go zones allow you to tell Kuri to avoid these trouble spots without changing your whole floor plan.
 
Open the Kuri App.
Select Robot Settings.
Select No Go Zones.
Take a look at your floor plan, and draw a square in the area you’d like her to avoid. 

KURI TIP: In order to move the box after you have drawn it, hold and drag the corners of the dotted box
Kuri looks a little Lost
Even with the best of floor plans, it’s easy to get a bit turned around from time to time. If Kuri seems to be wandering aimlessly, or if you notice a pulsing red heart light, there are a few things you can do to help her find her way home.  
Ask Kuri what’s wrong. You can just say, “Hey Kuri, are you lost?” If she nods yes, pick her up and place her back on the charger.  
If she doesn't respond, make sure you are connected to the internet and review how to talk to Kuri.
If she’s getting lost frequently, think about any changes you’ve made to your environment since the last time you did your floor plan.  Did you replace a big piece of furniture? Did you move Kuri’s charger? You might need to redo your floor plan. 
 
KURI TIP: If Kuri isn’t exploring and taking moments like he used to, he might be getting lost.
 
KURI TIP: If you find Kuri putting it in reverse all the time, he might be backing up because he’s confused by dark shiny surfaces or patches of bright sunlight.
Kuri keeps Running into Things
Depending on your style, Kuri might have a hard time avoiding certain pieces of furniture. If it’s happening on a regular basis, you can just set up a no-go zone over the offending object. 
Kuri Robot App
Kuri App Requirements
Apple:
Is your iPhone less than 5 years old? Then you should be good! 
iOS 10 and above
iPhone SE and later
The App froze or won’t open
If the Kuri app freezes, or won’t start up, it’s time to restart the app. Just force close and reopen it, and you should be on your way.
I don’t see any Moments that Kuri captured
If you can’t see any moments or a link to access moments on the web, it’s possible that there’s a problem with Kuri’s Wi-Fi connection.
 
Go to Kuri Live, and try to see through Kuri’s eyes.
If it doesn’t successfully connect, Kuri is offline.
Go to Robot Settings and select “Update Wi-Fi” to make sure she’s connected to the right network.
 
KURI TIP: You have to be close to Kuri to update his Wi-Fi connection, as this is done via Bluetooth.
Nobody can hear me when I talk through Kuri
If this happens, you might be muted in the app. Go to the 'Talk through Kuri' tab by tapping on the small microphone icon. You should see sound waves that change based on your volume. If you don't, go ahead and tap the big microphone button to get on the air!"

KURI TIP: It’s possible her volume is turned down. Look for the volume button on Kuri’s back, and turn it up until people can hear you speaking through Kuri.
I’m getting too many notifications
We get it. No one wants to be inundated by notifications.
To turn off notifications for collections you’re less interested in: 
Open the Kuri app.
Select ‘Settings.’
Select ‘Notifications.’
Unselect the collections you are no longer interested in.
How do I get to Override mode?
Override mode allows you to take Kuri for a joyride, so you can drive her to a specific spot in the home, communicate with members of your household, or even take a video on demand!
Go to Kuri Live.
Tap Override in the top right corner.
When the driving controls pop up, take Kuri for a spin.
Wifi - Basics and Issues
Basic Wi-Fi Requirements and Supported Networks
Kuri’s network requirements are pretty basic. She’s designed to work with a typical home network setup. She’ll need Wi-Fi to operate, and that coverage should extend wherever you want Kuri to go. So if there are known “dead spots” in your house, they will probably be an issue for Kuri as well. Basically, if your laptop and phone work on your home network, Kuri should do just fine. At a minimum, yours should include: 
A relatively modern Wi-Fi router (802.11 b/g/n)
2.4 or 5 GHz networks
0.5 Mbps upload bandwidth
For optimum performance, we recommend at least 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.

Kuri does not support hidden networks, where the SSID is not advertised, because he needs to be able to find the network to connect to it. He also doesn’t support enterprise networks requiring login and password to connect.

Though, Kuri loves mesh networks! We aren’t testing every type on the market, but Kuri generally plays well with others—including mesh networks.
Can I connect to multiple networks in my house?
Yes, Kuri can handle that, but not simultaneously.
Start out by opening the Kuri Robot app.
Tap Settings.
Tap Robot Settings.
Tap Update Wi-Fi.
Connect Kuri to the desired network.
Repeat for additional networks.
There’s no limit to the number of networks Kuri can remember! But if you want to control Kuri, you need to be on the same network as Kuri.
Can I connect to Kuri when I’m away from the house?
Kuri Live will not work remotely, but you can connect to Kuri if you’re on the same local network as her!
Help, I can’t connect to Wi-Fi
Kuri acts as a regular Wi-Fi device and will be susceptible to interference from other Wi-Fi devices. This can also occur if you’re in a Wi-Fi dead spot in your home. Try moving Kuri closer to your router and reconnecting.
Kuri is Offline and Having Trouble Connecting
Don't fret! If Kuri is having trouble connecting to Wi-Fi, we need to give him a helping hand by updating his Wi-Fi settings. 
Open up the Kuri App.
Tap the Settings icon in the bottom right corner.
Tap Robot Settings.
Tap Update Wi-Fi.
 
If your Kuri is having connectivity issues, usually indicated by a "Kuri is Offline" message in the app when attempting to access Kuri Live, this should do the trick. 
Why is Kuri so slow to respond?
You could be in a location in your home with a weak Wi-Fi signal. Try moving Kuri to a location closer to your router, then repeat your voice command again. If this happens frequently, you might look into getting a signal booster for your Wi-Fi.

KURI TIP: If you see a red light pulse twice after a voice command, Kuri might have lost her internet connection.
